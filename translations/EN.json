I currently reside in Dublin, where I have been living for approximately 2 years, and I have experience in the technology sector, having worked for Deloitte Spain and Accenture Ireland on large-scale projects. <br> <br> My education in Web Application Development provided me with a solid technical foundation, which I have continued to develop through my professional experience. I have worked on creating business solutions using SAP Fiori and ABAP, along with technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, JSON, jQuery, CSS, among others. My work has focused on improving various projects through the implementation of intuitive and functional applications. <br><br> I am passionate about technology in general and I am constantly updating my skills in new languages and tools to continue expanding my knowledge. I am fluent in both Spanish and English, which allows me to work in international environments and collaborate with teams from diverse cultures. <br> <br> My goal is to keep growing and learning, facing new challenges that allow me to add value to organizations.",
